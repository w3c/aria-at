# ARIA and Assistive Technologies (ARIA-AT)

This repo contains a test suite and harness for assessing AT support of ARIA. These tests are designed to be modular and embeddable in higher-level applications.

## Scope and Method

The initial scope of this test suite is manual tests for screen readers. Tests are written as assertions against accessible design patterns [examples from the ARIA Practices Guide](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/examples/).

## Running the tests

This repo includes a [prototype runner](https://w3c.github.io/aria-at/runner) which you can use to run the tests manually. Production runs of this material are run with [ARIA-AT-App](https://github.com/bocoup/aria-at-app).
