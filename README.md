The aim of this project is to facilitate consistently effective rendering of ARIA-enabled UIs by assistive technologies by:

1. Developing methodologies for assessing how effectively assistive technologies render ARIA patterns.
2. Providing a framework for collecting, discussing, and disseminating assessment information.
