# ARIA-AT Project Coverage

This document outlines the WAI-ARIA specification coverage by the current test plans within the ARIA-AT project. The following shorthand terminology is used throughout:

* ARIA: the [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) specification](https://w3c.github.io/aria/).
* APG: the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices guide](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/).

Note: for the purposes of coverage measurement, no distinction is made between WAI-ARIA states and properties.
