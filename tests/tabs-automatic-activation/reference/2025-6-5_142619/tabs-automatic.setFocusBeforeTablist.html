        <h2>About This Example</h2>
        <img alt="" class="example-page-example-icon" src="../../../images/pattern-tabs.svg">
        <p>
          This example section demonstrates a tabs widget that implements the <a href="../tabs-pattern.html">Tabs Pattern</a>.
          In this example, a tab is automatically activated and its associated panel is displayed when the tab receives focus.
          It is recommended that authors consider implementing automatic activation of tabs <strong>only in</strong> circumstances where panels can be displayed instantly, i.e., all panel content is present in the DOM.
          For additional guidance, see <a href="../../../practices/keyboard-interface/keyboard-interface-practice.html#kbd_selection_follows_focus">Deciding When to Make Selection Automatically Follow Focus</a>.

                Carl Joachim Andersen (29 April 1847 – 7 May 1909) was a Danish flutist, conductor and composer born in Copenhagen, son of the flutist Christian Joachim Andersen.
                Both as a virtuoso and as composer of flute music, he is considered one of the best of his time.
                He was considered to be a tough leader and teacher and demanded as such a lot from his orchestras but through that style he reached a high level.
